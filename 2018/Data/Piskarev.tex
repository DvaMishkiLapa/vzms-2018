Let the operator $A$ on a Banach space $X$ generates a bounded $C_0$-semigroup
and has dense range. In [1] the following following question was posed: does
$A^{-1}$ generate a bounded $C_0$-semigroup or at least generate a $C_0$-semigroup?

In [1,2] it was shown  that the answer is positive for generators of bounded
analytic $C_0$ semigroup.  For other classes of semigroups, as multiplication
semigroups or contraction semigroups in a Hilbert space, the answer is positive again.
When the semigroup generated by $A$ is exponentially stable, then $A^{-1}$ is a
bounded operator and accordingly it generates a  $C_0$ semigroup, but in general
it is not uniformly bounded. This situation is analysed by an explicit representation
of the semigroup generated $A^{-1}$ in [7,8], including growth estimates.
In [4] a sufficient condition on the resolvent map of $A$ under which $A^{-1}$
is the generator of a bounded  $C_0$-semigroup is provided. Several equivalences
for $A^{-1}$ generating a $C_0$-semigroup are given in [3]. There is a way to
show that even if $A^{-1}$ does not generate bounded $C_0$-semigroup it can generate
integrated semigroup [5,6]. Such fact can be used to solve ill-posed problems.

The main result of this note is  the following statement: if $A$ is the generator
of a tempered $\beta$-times integrated $\alpha$-resolvent operator function and
is injective, then the inverse operator $A^{-1}$ is the generator of a tempered
$\gamma$-times integrated $\alpha$-resolvent operator function for
$\gamma > \beta+1/2,$ and it is also the generator of a tempered $\delta$-times
resolvent operator function for $\delta < \alpha.$
